# button.sh — launch network-browser-hq as its own detached X11 process.
# Usage: button.sh <house_root>
#
# REAL, NEW 2026-09-01 (khtpm-generic-dispatch-design.md's own real
# conversion writeup) - network-browser's own real hand-rolled renderer
# (network_browser_render.c) is REPLACED here by the SAME shared
# renderer every other khtpm window uses (khtpm_core_render.+x), pointed
# at a real, checked-in bootstrap network-browser-hq.chtpm. That bootstrap
# declares a <module> tag (the renderer's own generic launch_module()
# mechanism, real, already proven for db-hq/events-hq/chat-hai/open-hai,
# newly wired up for this default/popup mode too) which starts
# network_browser_manager.+x as a real child process - the manager then
# overwrites the SAME .chtpm file with its own live, real projection
# (current page/address/links/status, via its own write_chtpm_projection()),
# picked up by the renderer's generic capability #1 (live .chtpm re-parse)
# within one tick. This script only ever launches ONE process (the
# renderer) - the manager is its real child, tied to its lifetime exactly
# like db-hq/events-hq/chat-hai/open-hai's own managers already are, so
# closing the window also stops the manager (no separate PID for this
# script to track).
#
# network_browser_render.c's OWN old real entry point (the real manager)
# is left in place, unused, as a real rollback reference - not deleted.
# build.sh (the old render binary's own build script) is likewise
# untouched.

# REAL FIX 2026-09-01 (live report: after the manager's own real
# projection overwrites network-browser-hq.chtpm - its normal, intended
# job every tick - a STRAY manager process (an orphan from a previous
# relaunch, or any other writer) landing one more write on this SAME path
# after the window that launched it is gone permanently erases the
# <module> tag this launcher's whole mechanism depends on: the NEXT launch
# finds no module tag, and NEVER starts a manager again at all, silently,
# with zero error - confirmed live, reproduced multiple times).
# Self-heal here, every launch: a real, permanent, never-overwritten
# template (network-browser-hq.chtpm.bootstrap, copied once from the real
# checked-in bootstrap) restores the live path whenever it's missing its
# own <module> tag, before this script ever execs the renderer.
